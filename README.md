## 📄 Description

This project is a simple ToDo List created only for practicing TypeScript.
I built this list using TypeScript to get familiar with types, interfaces, and DOM manipulation in TypeScript.
This is my first experience with TypeScript, and the goal was just learning and practice.

<br/>


## 🖱️ Usage

1. Type your task inside the input field.
2. To add the task: You can either click the ➕ button Or simply press the Enter key on your keyboard.
3. When you hover over a task, a 🗑 (trash bin) button appears, allowing you to delete that specific task.
4. To remove all tasks at once, you can use the Clear All button.


<br/>
<br/>


## ✨ Features

- Add new tasks (using the + button or Enter key)
- Delete individual tasks (trash bin button appears on hover)
- Clear all tasks at once (with the Clear All button)
- Tasks are stored in Local Storage (they persist even after closing/reloading the page)
- Built with TypeScript to practice types, interfaces, and safe coding
- Real-time UI updates (list always reflects the current state)
- Simple and minimal UI for learning and practicing
